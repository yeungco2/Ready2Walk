The major issue in gait rehabilitation is that patients who are recovering at home requires objective measurements to inform them of gait deviations such as uneven weight distributions, that they normally cannot detect on their own. Objective measurements of gait deviations exist, but are often only used in research setting and not widely used during the rehabilitation process. Our stakeholders have confirmed that a device that can provide patients with gait feedback to help them detect and potentially correct uneven weight distribution at home can possibly help to reduce their likelihood of developing secondary complications. Proposed engineering design for this purpose should use existing gait parameters identified in research (e.g. trunk lateral lean, uneven insole ground reaction force) and incorporate it into a feedback device that can be readily used by patients at home to help them correct their gait.
